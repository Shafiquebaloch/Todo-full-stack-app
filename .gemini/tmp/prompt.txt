You are an expert full-stack developer implementing Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application using strict Spec-Driven Development with Spec-Kit Plus. Use this complete specification as the single source of truth (do NOT add, remove, or change anything from it) # Phase II Specification Todo Full-Stack Web Application Multi-user Todo Management System ## 1. Project Overview & Objectives The Todo Full-Stack Web Application is a fresh, independent multi-user web-based task management system designed to allow individuals to create, organize, and track their personal tasks in a secure and intuitive way. The primary objective is to provide a reliable, private, and user-centric experience where each user has complete control over their own tasks, with strong data isolation to ensure privacy. The system supports full task lifecycle management (create, read, update, delete, and completion toggle) while maintaining simplicity, responsiveness, and security. This application is built from scratch as a standalone project and is not an extension or evolution of any previous console-based version. ## 2. Target Users & Personas - **Primary Persona: Busy Individual** Professionals, students, or freelancers who need a simple, secure way to manage daily tasks without sharing data with others. - **Secondary Persona: Privacy-conscious User** Users who value strong data isolation and want assurance that no one else (including other users) can access or see their tasks. - **Guest/Anonymous User** Users who want to quickly try the application without creating an account. ## 3. Core Functional Requirements The system must support the following core features for authenticated users: - Create a new task with a title and optional description - View a list of all personal tasks - View details of a single task - Update any task (title and description) - Delete any personal task - Toggle the completion status of any personal task All operations must be restricted to the authenticated user's own data. ## 4. Authentication & Authorization Rules - Users must be able to sign up and sign in to access personalized features - Authentication must provide a verified user identity for every protected request - Every task belongs exclusively to one user - No user can ever view, modify, or delete another user's tasks (strict ownership enforcement) - Unauthorized access attempts must be rejected with appropriate errors ## 5. User Stories 1. As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password so that I can create my own account. 2. As a returning user, I want to sign in securely so that I can access my personal tasks. 3. As an authenticated user, I want to create a new task with a title so that I can add things to my todo list. 4. As an authenticated user, I want to see a list of only my own tasks so that I can track what I need to do. 5. As an authenticated user, I want to view the details of any of my tasks so that I can review them. 6. As an authenticated user, I want to update the title or description of any of my tasks so that I can correct mistakes or add details. 7. As an authenticated user, I want to delete any of my tasks so that I can remove completed or unnecessary items. 8. As an authenticated user, I want to mark any task as complete or incomplete so that I can track progress. 9. As an authenticated user, I want to be prevented from accessing another user's tasks so that my privacy is protected. 10. As a user attempting unauthorized access, I want to receive a clear error message so that I understand why the action was denied. 11. As a user with invalid credentials, I want to receive a login error so that I can correct my details. 12. As a user who forgets their password, I want a password reset option so that I can regain access. 13. As a privacy-conscious user, I want to have assurance that no one else can see or modify my tasks so that my data remains secure. ## 6. API Behavior Contract (high-level, non-technical) The system must expose a RESTful interface with the following behavior: - GET /api/{user_id}/tasks → Returns only the requesting user's list of tasks - POST /api/{user_id}/tasks → Creates a new task belonging to the requesting user - GET /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} → Returns details of one task belonging to the requesting user - PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} → Updates a task belonging to the requesting user - DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id} → Deletes a task belonging to the requesting user - PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete → Toggles completion status of a task belonging to the requesting user All endpoints must enforce ownership: the requesting user must match the user_id in the path. ## 7. Data & Persistence Rules - All tasks must be persistently stored - Tasks must be associated with their owning user - Data must survive application restarts - No task data may be shared between users ## 8. Non-Functional Requirements - **Security**: Strong user isolation; all operations must be authenticated and authorized; protect against unauthorized access - **Performance**: Task list should load quickly (under 1 second for typical usage) - **Usability**: Intuitive interface; responsive design for mobile and desktop - **Reliability**: Data must not be lost on errors; clear error messages for failures ## 9. Acceptance Criteria **Signup & Signin** - User can create account with email/password - User can log in with correct credentials - Invalid credentials return error **Task CRUD** - Authenticated user can create task → task appears in their list - Authenticated user can view only their own tasks - Update/delete/toggle complete works only on own tasks - Attempting to access another user's task returns access denied **Ownership Enforcement** - Every API call must be tied to authenticated user - Mismatch between user_id and authenticated identity → error ## 10. Important Edge Cases & Failure Modes - User tries to access another user's task → access denied - Invalid or expired authentication → unauthorized error - Empty task list → show empty state message - Network failure during create/update → show retry option - Duplicate email during signup → show error - Concurrent updates to same task → handle conflict gracefully ## 11. Out of Scope for Phase II - Guest/anonymous access - Task sharing or collaboration - Advanced task features (recurring, reminders, attachments) - Mobile app version - Third-party integrations beyond basic auth Rules for implementation: • This is a fresh, independent project – NOT connected to any previous console app. • 100% technology-agnostic in spec – but for implementation use: Next.js (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, JWT for auth. • Project folder: hackathon-todo-web/ • Enforce strong user isolation in every operation. • Generate code only based on this specification – no extra assumptions. Current status: Project skeleton exists (basic backend with /health, frontend welcome page). Start implementation now. Generate/update files in this format: === backend/main.py === [full code] === frontend/src/app/page.tsx === [full code] After each major part, say "Part complete – next: [next step]""
